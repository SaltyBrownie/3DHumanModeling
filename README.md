## 🛠️Work Flow
- [x] Capture 3D model 
- [x] Clean Mesh and create platform
- [x] Print 3D model
- [x] Post processing for aestethic look
- [ ] Paint for improved realism
- [ ] Improve 3D scan model by using LIDAR sensor or higher mega pixel Camera.

## Objective
- Create a 3D model of a human with at least 80% similarity
- Print out mesh on a 3D printer with Fused Deposition Modeling technology
- Document the process and share the results.

## 💻Software
## PolyCam
> Polycam is the leading 3D capture application for iPhone and iPad! Create high-quality 3D models from photos with any iPhone or iPad, and rapidly generate scans of spaces with the LiDAR sensor. Edit your 3D captures directly on device, and export them in over a dozen file formats.

### Fusion 360
> Fusion 360 is a commercial computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, computer-aided engineering and printed circuit board design software application, developed by Autodesk. It is available for Windows and macOS, with simplified applications available for Android and iOS

### Ultimaker Cura
> Cura is an open source slicing application for 3D printers. It was created by David Braam who was later employed by Ultimaker, a 3D printer manufacturing company, to maintain the software. Cura is available under LGPLv3 license

### Creality Ender 3V2
- Printer used is stock model with little modifications
