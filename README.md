## 🛠️Work Flow
- [x] Capture 3D model 
- [x] Clean Mesh and create 3D platform
- [x] Print 3D model
- [x] Post processing for aestethic look
### To Do 🖌️ 🎥
- [ ] Paint for improved realism [Acrylic or Airbrush]
```
https://all3dp.com/2/beginner-s-guide-to-painting-3d-prints-pla-abs/
```
- [ ] Improve 3D scan model by using LIDAR sensor or higher mega pixel Camera.

## Objective 📝
- Create a 3D model of a human with at least 80% similarity
- Print out mesh on a 3D printer with Fused Deposition Modeling technology
- Showcase the AR model Potential of a customised human scanning
- Document the process and share the results.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
```
This project was done in my home in Singapore where the Average Humidity:65% and Temperature:30°C
Settings used are from all 3dp, Stringing still occurs possible due to wet and old filament.

The Free Trial Version of the software was used.

### Fusion 360
> Fusion 360 is a commercial computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, computer-aided engineering and printed circuit board design software application, developed by Autodesk. It is available for Windows and macOS, with simplified applications available for Android and iOS

Fusion 360 Autodesk education licence was used for learning purposes only.

### Ultimaker Cura
> Cura is an open source slicing application for 3D printers. It was created by David Braam who was later employed by Ultimaker, a 3D printer manufacturing company, to maintain the software. Cura is available under LGPLv3 license

Setting for PLA was adjusted to fit the selected filament brand and type.
